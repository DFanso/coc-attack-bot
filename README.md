## Quick Start Guide

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always run Clash of Clans in FULL SCREEN mode during all operations!**

### 1. Initial Setup

1. **Open Clash of Clans in FULL SCREEN mode** (this is crucial for accurate coordinates)
2. Run the bot: `python main.py`
3. Go to "Game Detection" to verify the bot can find your game window
4. Take a screenshot to confirm the capture area is correct

### 2. Map Key Coordinates

**This is the most important step - you need to map button positions for your specific screen resolution.**

1. Select "Coordinate Mapping" from the main menu
2. Choose "Start coordinate mapping"
3. Move your mouse to important game elements and press **F2** to record each position:
   - **Attack button** (to start searching for bases)
   - **Next button** (to skip bases during search)
   - **Army camps** (to check if army is ready)
   - **Troop selection buttons** (barbarians, archers, spells, etc.)
   - **Deploy positions** (where to place troops on the base)
   - **Return home button** (after attack completion)
4. Enter descriptive names for each coordinate (e.g., "attack_button", "barbarian", "archer")
5. Press **F3** to save all coordinates when finished

**Essential coordinates to map:**
- `attack_button` - The attack button to start base search
- `next_button` - Skip to next base during search
- `find_a_match` - find a match button

- `barbarian` - Barbarian troop selection
- `archer` - Archer troop selection
- `spell1` - First spell slot
- `return_home` - Return home after attack

### 3. Record Attack Strategies

1. Select "Attack Recording" from the main menu
2. Choose "Start new recording"
3. Enter a descriptive name for your attack strategy (e.g., "barch_collector_raid")
4. **Manual Mode (Recommended):** Press **F6** to record each click precisely
5. Use **F7** to add delays between actions when needed
6. Record a complete attack sequence from troop deployment to completion
7. Press **F5** when finished to stop and save the recording

**Recording Tips:**
- Record different strategies for different base types
- Include delays between troop deployments for better timing
- Record the full sequence including returning home

### 4. Set Up Auto Attacker (AI-Powered)

1. Ensure you have configured your Gemini API key in `src\utils\config.py`
2. Select "Auto Attacker" from the main menu
3. Choose "Start auto attack"
4. Set your minimum loot requirements:
   - Minimum gold (default: 300,000)
   - Minimum elixir (default: 300,000)
   - Minimum dark elixir (default: 2,000)
5. Select the attack strategy you want to use
6. The bot will automatically:
   - Search for bases
   - Analyze loot using AI
   - Attack suitable bases
   - Return home and repeat

### 5. Manual Attack Playback

1. Select "Attack Playback" from the main menu
2. Choose "Play attack"
3. Select your recorded session
4. Make sure COC is in the attack screen with a base loaded
5. Press Enter to begin playback

**Playback Tips:**
- Ensure game state matches when the recording was made
- Use slower playback speeds for more reliable execution
- Always supervise the playback process

## Configuration

The bot uses `src\utils\config.py` for all configuration settings. After copying from `example.config.py`, you can modify:

### Essential Settings

**AI Analysis Settings:**
- `google_gemini_api_key` - Your Gemini API key (required for AI features)
- `enabled` - Set to `True` to enable AI base analysis
- `min_gold`, `min_elixir`, `min_dark_elixir` - Minimum loot requirements for auto attacks

**Other Settings:**
- Hotkey bindings for all operations
- Default directories for screenshots, recordings, coordinates
- Automation timing and speed settings
- Game detection parameters

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Full Screen Mode** - **ALWAYS** run Clash of Clans in full screen mode for accurate coordinate mapping
2. **Screen Resolution** - Keep your screen resolution consistent between recording and playback
3. **Game State** - Make sure COC is in the same state when playing back attacks
4. **Coordinate Mapping** - Take time to accurately map all essential buttons and positions
5. **Practice Mode** - Test your recordings on practice attacks first
6. **Playback Speed** - Use slower speeds (0.5x) for more reliable playback
7. **AI Analysis** - Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota
8. **Supervision** - Always supervise the bot during operation
9. **Army Ready** - Make sure your army is trained before starting auto attacks
10. **Internet Connection** - Stable internet required for AI analysis features

## Safety Features

- **Failsafe** - Move mouse to top-left corner to stop all automation
- **Emergency Stop** - Press ESC during any operation to stop immediately
- **Validation** - Recordings are validated before playback
- **Logging** - All actions are logged for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Game Not Detected
- Make sure COC is running and visible
- Try different window modes (full screen vs windowed)
- Check if you're using a supported emulator

### Playback Issues
- Verify coordinates are mapped correctly for your resolution
- Check that the game is in the correct state before playback
- Try slower playback speeds
- Validate recordings before playing them

### Recording Problems
- Make sure the recording hotkeys aren't conflicting with other software
